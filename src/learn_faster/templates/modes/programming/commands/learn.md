description: Initialize or continue learning a programming topic using project-based approach
---

## Context

- Topic to learn: $ARGUMENTS
- Current topic: !`ls .learning/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v scripts`

**Note:** The `.learning/` directory is already initialized. Check the topic folder name (ignore `scripts/`).

## Your Task

Initialize learning for the topic "$ARGUMENTS" using the FASTER framework with project-based approach.

**If a topic already exists:**

- Inform: "This project is already learning [topic name]"
- Check for due reviews first (conduct before new learning if any)
- Continue with current topic (1 project = 1 learning goal)

**If no topic exists yet:**

1. **Gather learning preferences** with `AskUserQuestion` based on user's selected topic:
   <example>

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What level do you want to achieve with [topic]?",
    "header": "Level",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Beginner", "description": "Fundamentals and basic syntax"},
      {"label": "Intermediate", "description": "Common patterns and projects"},
      {"label": "Advanced", "description": "Architecture and optimization"},
      {"label": "Expert", "description": "Deep internals and best practices"}
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your learning goal?",
    "header": "Goal",
    "multiSelect": true,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Build projects", "description": "Learn by building real applications"},
      {"label": "Understand deeply", "description": "How things work under the hood"},
      {"label": "Best practices", "description": "Production-ready code patterns"},
      {"label": "Interview prep", "description": "Problem-solving and algorithms"}
    ]
  }
]
```

</example>

2. Run: `python3 .learning/scripts/init_learning.py "[topic name]" .learning`
3. Parse JSON output and follow `llm_directive`
4. **READ** `.learning/<topic-slug>/syllabus.md` to see the template structure
5. Generate comprehensive syllabus **focused on project-based learning**
6. **Replace** the template placeholders with actual content
7. Update metadata: `"syllabus_generated": true` in `.learning/<topic-slug>/metadata.json`

**Programming Mode Syllabus Guidelines:**

- Structure around building progressively complex projects
- Each phase should include 2-3 concepts + 1-2 🔨 hands-on projects
- Projects should build on previous concepts
- Include testing and debugging at each phase
- Focus on understanding "how it works" not just "how to use it"
- Use checkboxes `- [ ]` for tracking progress

**Important:**

- Generate comprehensive, project-focused syllabi
- Every concept should lead to building something
- Include code quality and best practices throughout
